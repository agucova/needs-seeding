# needs-seeding ðŸŒ±
A script that downloads a list of .torrent files from a website, checks their health and lists the ones that need more seeding.

## Requirements
The script requires a working python â‰¥ 3.5 installation.

If you have Python [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) you can install the dependencies directly:

```shell
poetry install
```
If not, you can use the equivalent `requirements.txt`:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The script is very much a work in progress, so while the objective is to make it a full CLI and later a webapp, for now you'll have to change the constants in `main.py` and run the program.
